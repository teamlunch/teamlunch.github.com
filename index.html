            <h1>About Our Project</h1>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
               Small UAVs are difficult to fly, easily damaged by collision, and expensive to repair.This presents a strong financial risk to potential buyers, and discourages widespread adoption.  As UAVs move to urban and indoor environments, this risk is dramatically increased â€“ both in likelihood of collision with environmental clutter, and potential damage to surrounding persons or property.
            </p>

            <h3>Our Project</h3>
            <p>
               To mitigate this risk, we will equip a small UAV with an autonomous collision detection and avoidance system.  This system will allow unskilled operators to purchase and fly UAVs in close-quarters environments with minimal risk of damage to the UAV or surrounding property.
            </p>
            <p>
               The prototype system will consist of two main components: a Parrot AR.Drone UAV, modified with autonomous collision avoidance software and supporting sensors; and an open-source Android-based ground station, modified to provide feedback to the operator about obstacles and near misses.
            </p>
            <p>
               As this project is primarily software-focused, hardware will be purchased rather than built where possible.  The UAV and sensors will be purchased outright, and an Android tablet will be used to host the modified open-source ground station.
            </p>

            <h1>Project Schedule &amp; Deliverables</h1>
            <p>
               This project will be completed in an iterative manner, and its final scope will depend on technical obstacles and time constraints.
            </p>

            <h3>Phase One: Ground-Based Test Bench</h3>
            <p>
               In the first phase of our project, the UAV will establish communication with its onboard sensors, and relay basic data to a ground-based test bench.
            </p>

               <b>Est. Completion</b> Currently Undecided<br />
            </p>

            <h3>Phase Two: Autonomous Collision Avoidance</h3>
            <p>
               Upon completion of the second phase of our project, the UAV will autonomously ignore dangerous operator commands, and move away from approaching obstacles.

            <h3>Phase Three: Ground Station Enhancement</h3>
            <p>
               The third phase of our project focuses around enhancement of an Android-based ground station software suite.  The ground station will be modified to provide non-intrusive feedback about automatically-avoided collisions and nearby obstacles.
